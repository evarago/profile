### ⁉️ a litte more about...

### relationships
I assume you are very good at your job, and that you are here to deliver great value to our company and people. You are the expert as well. I will work to provide necessary context and ask questions to help you get your ideas but I will not override you.
You will let me know if I am blocking you. One of my main responsibilities is ensuring that we are set up for success. Please reach out and let me know how I can help.

### comms
I usually ask questions and i am not afraid of not knowing things. I will seek help whenever necessary. If it feels like I am questioning you it is because I am either: 1 - trying to gather context or 2 - trying to understand if everyone is on the same page.

### 1-on-1 meetings
I value connecting with my teammates regularly. I am a fan of 1:1s, and also love to experience the almost "in-person" interactions of a video call.
As a mentor/manager, I believe 1:1s are for you to set the agenda. What would you like to talk about? What is going well? What is bugging you? How can I help you? If there are things that I want to ask you, I will do it, but this is your time. If I have feedback, I will also provide it during this time.
By default, you should schedule a bi-weekly, 30 minute conversation with me. I prefer that you schedule the meeting, as you can pick a time that works for your time.

### feedbacks
I prefer to give and receive written feedback (async), so the information can be first digested, to be then discussed together (sync). I love feedback, it is critical to my success here.  You will find me asking for ongoing feedback on things I can do better, things I can improve, and things I am doing well. I want it to be a two-way street. If you are ever surprised by any feedback from me on your reviews then I have not done my job right.

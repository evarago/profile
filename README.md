### ⁉️ a litte more about...

### ALLTogetter
I assume you are very good at your job, and that you are here to deliver great value to our company and people. You are the expert as well. I will work to provide necessary context and ask questions to help you get your ideas but I will not override you.
Here, the bond of trust, the sense of ownership and entrepreneurship is very important. Do, do and do. Test, make mistakes, fix, retest, pivot if necessary.
You will let me know if I am blocking you. One of my main responsibilities is ensuring that we are set up for success. Please reach out and let me know how I can help.

### how
Clear objectives and key results. Clear DoR (Definition of Read) and DoD (Definition of Done). Togetter we can define strategy to reach the goals, basead on OKRs, KPIs of the company and then, act. How measure? Follow indicators as NPS (Net Promoter Score), eNPS (in case of internal customers), TTM (Time To Market), MTTA (Medium Time To Analysis), Cycle Time, MTTR (Mean Time To Repair) and quality indicators (Number of incidents, Number of deployments/deliveries).  

### comms
I usually ask questions and i am not afraid of not knowing things. I will seek help whenever necessary. If it feels like I am questioning you it is because I am either: 1 - trying to gather context or 2 - trying to understand if everyone is on the same page.

### 1-on-1 meetings
I value connecting with my teammates regularly. I am a fan of 1:1s, and also love to experience the almost "in-person" interactions of a video call.
As a mentor/manager, I believe 1:1s are for you to set the agenda. What would you like to talk about? What is going well? What does not going well? How can I help you? If there are things that I want to ask you, I will do it, but this is your time. If I have feedback, I will also provide it during this time.
By default, we have schedule a bi-weekly, 30 minute conversation and we can pick a time that works for your time.

### feedbacks
I prefer to give and receive written feedback (async), so the information can be first digested, to be then discussed together (sync). I love feedback, it is critical to my success here.  You will find me asking for ongoing feedback on things I can do better, things I can improve, and things I am doing well. I want it to be a two-way street. If you are ever surprised by any feedback from me on your reviews then I have not done my job right.
